# Most Similar Tweets in Real-Time

Twinkle is a Natural Language Processing model capable of processing a growing database of billions of text documents and computing similarities in real-time, using a hashing vectorizer and a locality sensitive hashing forest sequentially to achieve sub-linear scaling of computation time!
This could be offered as a feature on Twitter, allowing users to view a list of most similar tweets as they type a new tweet.

## Motivations

When we adopt a tool we also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool. Twitter is training the users towards conciseness and expressivity. Our daily practice of integrity on social media is improving our use of language, refining our actions and personalities and swiftly lead to evolution of the society beyond traditional expectations.

- **Growth of Positive Interactions** Having the most similar tweets available to the user would significantly enhance the user experience on twitter by creating a strong sense of connection, encouraging creativity and expressivity, enriching communication and lead to much more exciting interactions on Twitter. Hashtags usually offer creative variations or alternatives for the actual context of the tweet. Resemblence of the entire tweet however, displays a much more exciting connection and offering this feature would quickly increase positive interactions.
- **User Growth** Twitter is live: live commentary, live conversations, live connections; growth of positive interactions could be the most powerful opportunity to attract and increase the number of monthly active users and excite advertisers. Twitter is well-positioned to benefit from this headway.

## Challenge

The application has to process billions of tweets to find the most similar recommendations for any given new tweet as it is being typed. In order to implement this feature in real-time we must create a solution to significantly lower the computation run-time.

## Real-Time Solution

Sublinear scaling of runtime with sequential use of Hashing Vectorizer and Locality Sensitive Hashing Forest
- Similar items map to the same “buckets” with high probability (the number of buckets being much smaller than the universe of possible inputs)
- LSH Forest generates hash trees
- Uses hashing to define a neighborhood
- Access to Nearest Neighbors Algorithm methods
- Search space is limited to a bucket
- Computes similarities to a small portion of tweets
- As the database of text documents grows larger, runtime stays the same

## LSH Forest
Locality Sensitive Hashing forest is an alternative method for vanilla approximate nearest neighbor search methods. In Scikit-Learn, LSH forest data structure has been implemented using sorted arrays and binary search and 32 bit fixed-length hashes. Random projection is used as the hash family which approximates cosine distance.

```python
hv = HashingVectorizer(n_features=10000, non_negative=True)
docs_vectorized = hv.fit_transform(docs_joined).toarray()

# Local Sensitivity Hashing Forest
lshf = LSHForest(random_state=42, radius_cutoff_ratio=0.4)
lshf.fit(docs_vectorized)

# Hashing new input
new_doc_vectorized = hv.transform(new_doc).toarray()

# Distances & indices
dist, ind= lshf.radius_neighbors(new_doc_vectorized, return_distance=True)
```

LSHForest uses internally random hyperplanes to index the samples into buckets and actual cosine similarities are only computed for samples that collide with the query hence achieving sublinear scaling.

#### Data

Twitter Streaming API</br>
The WordNet lemmatizer and word_tokenize functions from NLTK were applied to tokenize the text documents before training.
</br>
## Future Direction

Offering <b>Transformative Suggestions</b> for tweets before they are posted.
```
"JFK: I would never lie to you"  ->  "I have integrity for greater good”
```
This is modeled based on:
  * Word-Sense Induction
  * Intertextuality
  * Sentiment Analysis
  * Grammar
  * Conceptual vs Literal Alacrity</br>
```
  "JFK: I would never lie to you." => Conceptual
  "Good Morning” => Literal
```
  * Giving Weight-Power to Words:</br>
```
  "Audacity of Hope" vs. "Make America Great Again”
```
