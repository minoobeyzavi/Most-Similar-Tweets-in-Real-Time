# Most Similar Tweets in Real-Time

I have created a Natural Language Processing model capable of processing a growing database of billions of tweets and computing similarities in real-time, using a hashing vectorizer and a locality sensitive hashing forest sequentially to achieve sub-linear scaling of computation time.
This could be offered as a feature on Twitter, allowing users to type their tweets and be instantly presented with a list of most similar tweets previously posted.

## Goal

When we adopt a tool we also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool. Having the most similar tweets available to the author would significantly enhance the user experience on twitter by creating a strong sense of connection, encouraging creativity and expressivity, enriching communications and conversations and lead to much more exciting interactions on Twitter.</br>
Trending Hashtags are consciously determined per tweet, usually offering creative variations or alternatives for the actual context of the tweet, sometimes even ironically unrelated phrases to express sarcasm; 
(hash)tags are secondary in importance as opposed to the tweet itself. Therefore, similarity of tweets is the more 
clear window into the flow of topics and use of language, and quickly result in growth of interaction.

## Challenge

The application has to process billions of tweets to find the most similar recommendations for any given new tweet as it is being typed. In order to implement this feature in real-time we must create a solution to significantly lower the computation run-time.

## Real-Time solution

Sublinear scaling of runtime with sequential use of Hashing Vectorizer and Locality Sensitive Hashing Forest
- Similar items map to the same “buckets” with high probability (the number of buckets being much smaller than the universe of possible inputs)
- LSH Forest generates hash trees
- Uses hashing to define a neighborhood
- Access to Nearest Neighbors Algorithm methods
- Search space is limited to a bucket
- Computes similarities to a small portion of tweets
- As the database of text documents grows larger, runtime stays the same

## LSH Forest
Locality Sensitive Hashing forest [1] is an alternative method for vanilla approximate nearest neighbor search methods. In Scikit-Learn, LSH forest data structure has been implemented using sorted arrays and binary search and 32 bit fixed-length hashes. Random projection is used as the hash family which approximates cosine distance.

```python
hv = HashingVectorizer(n_features=10000, non_negative=True)
docs_vectorized = hv.fit_transform(docs_joined).toarray()

# Local Sensitivity Hashing Forest
lshf = LSHForest(random_state=42, radius_cutoff_ratio=0.4)
lshf.fit(docs_vectorized)

# Hashing new input
new_doc_vectorized = hv.transform(new_doc).toarray()

# Distances & indices
dist, ind= lshf.radius_neighbors(new_doc_vectorized, return_distance=True)
```

LSHForest uses internally random hyperplanes to index the samples into buckets and actual cosine similarities are only computed for samples that collide with the query hence achieving sublinear scaling.

## Future Direction

Transformative Suggestions on tweets whilst editing the tweet - to be offered as a feature on Twitter.
</br></br>
"J.F.Kennedy: I would never lie to you."  ->  "I have integrity for greater good.”
</br></br>
This is modeled based on:
  * Words and expressions
  * Context
  * Intertextuality
  * Classification of sentiment
  * Grammar
  * Conceptual vs literal alacrity and contradictions of the two:</br>
```
  "John F. Kennedy: I would never lie to you." => Conceptual
  "Good Morning” => Literal
```
  * Giving weight-power to words:</br>
```
  "Audacity of Hope" vs. "Make America Great Again”
```
